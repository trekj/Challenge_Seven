# Web Application for an ETF Analyzer
In this Python project, we are going to build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

## Technologies
This project is written in ***Python 3.8*** with the following libraries:

***panda*** -a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive.

***numpy*** -is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

***SQLAlchemy*** is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

***hvplot*** - A high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.


## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

import sqlalchemy

import hvplot.pandas


## Usage

After cloning the repository,  open the directory Starter Code and run the program by typing python etf_analyzer.ipynb
